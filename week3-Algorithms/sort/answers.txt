sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It in the average scenario, performs less better than sort2 and similar to sort3,
so it is the bubble sort alg.
best case:   0.681s
avg case:    8.0s


sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: In the average scenario, it is by far the best sorting alg., so it is the mergesort
best case:  0.691s
avg case:   1.0s


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: In the best case scenario (i.e. trying to sort an already list of values),
the selection sort has a complexity of (n^2), the biggest among the sorting algorithms presented.

best case: 3.4s
avg case:  3.8s
